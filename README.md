# FastAPI and Vue.js Example Apps

I found an [article](https://6chaoran.github.io/data-story/visualization/data-engineering/fastapi-vue-app/) describing how to make a quick and dirty Vue.js front-end to a FastAPI application.

The example uses some ML stuff that, while interesting, is more than I have energy for right now, so I'll make a much simpler API, and see if I can fudge the rest.

This is morphing into a collection of FastAPI playground applications.

## Examples

- [Calculator](./Calculator/README.md) - A simple calculator with a Vuetify web UI.
- [ErrorHandler](./ErrorHandler/README.md) - Tries to log errors with malformed requests.

## Ideas

- Test various methods of Prometheus metrics
- Test multiple applications mounted under the primary mount
